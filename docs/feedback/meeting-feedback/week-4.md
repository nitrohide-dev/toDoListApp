# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Konrad
Minute taker: Matus

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback:
> The agenda was not posted on Gitlab in time. This is a hard requirement, so please do this for upcoming meetings, otherwise this section will be marked with an insufficient.

> Regarding the content, the agenda now follows the provided template, which is a great improvement from last week. It also contains a good amount of subtasks/questions for the TA, which is good.

> However, you should try to reformat it, since there are some inconsistencies: not all tasks have the same amount of spacing, some are bolded but some are not, etc. You can try to have the titles of the topics with a header markdown instead of a bold to accentuate it more. Here is the markdown guide for basic syntax, you may find it helpful: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/



#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Sufficient

Previous minute taker: Jimmy

Feedback: 
> From a content perspective, the notes should contain in a more detailed and concrete way the agreements established during the meeting. This is very important from a progress perspective, since the meeting notes are usually revisited throughout the project to check/remember details or to use in case of conflicts. Moreover, the notes are not very clear and a bit messy overall.

> In order to fix this, you don't necessarily need to write more notes during the meeting, but at least try to reformat them after and clean them up. Also, it would be more readable to actually write the notes under each task instead of writing a whole bunch of text at the end.



#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: 
> The chair ensured that all topics are extensively covered and successfully coordinated the meeting. Great job!


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 
> Each member of the team showcased their ideas and everybody was interested and receptive in the team's opinions. There is an overall constructive and positive athmosphere, great job!


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback:
> As mentioned in the code contribution feedback, you are behind schedule. Please be more involved code-wise in this project and I hope to see some progress in the upcoming meeting.
