# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Atanas
Minute taker: Robert

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: 
> I'm glad you incorporated my feedback and decided to switch to the required template for the agenda.

> It is well detailed and contains a good amount of subtopics that clarify the main points of the meeting. Great job!

> A suggestion i can give you is to also add some minute guidelines for each point of action, so that you know when to change the pace of the meeting.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Sufficient

Previous minute taker: Matus

Feedback:
> The notes are somewhat coherent, but very short and not integrated in the agenda (i.e. written at the end of the file instead of after each topic). Try to be more descriptive on the agreements and TA advice, I'm sure there were multiple issues discussed that could have been acknowledged as well. 

> Being a notetaker is quite hard, so strive to balance as much as possible your role with active participation in the meeting.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
> The chair successfully coordinated the meeting and presented the agenda topics. 

> However, not all topics were covered extensively. Try to add some estimations for each topic to ensure that you will have enough time to discuss everything in enough detail.



#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 

> Everybody is sharing their opinions freely during the meeting. I like that you are all open to the other teammates' ideas, which is great.



#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 

> You are on track with the project so far, good job! Please start working on the wiring to finish the basic features and start working on the advanced features from now on so that you remain on track.
