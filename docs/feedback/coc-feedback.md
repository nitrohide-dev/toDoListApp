# Code of conduct

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The file was correctly submitted, but has a different name than requested (code-of-conduct). Please name all your files as specified in the assignment description (in this case, it was specified on the website).

### General

Mark: Good

Feedback: Overall, the Code of Conduct contains correct information, without unnecessary additions. However, most sections could use some improvement regarding the level of detail and coherence.

### Assignment Description

Mark: Good

Feedback: The description is good and clear, but lacks some details. For example, you can add more information about the team experience and what you are supposed to learn from participating in a group project.

### Products

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The description of what your application should do is completely missing. I appreciate that you want to keep a clean and concise document, but please be more detailed.

### Planning

Mark: Good

Feedback: The goals and agreements are clear and realistic, but lack specificity. It is not clear how/when are you selecting the person who is responsible for the deliverables. Also, you kind of avoided the first question, i.e. gave an ambiguous response ("How do you ensure that each team member finishes everything on time?" - you can set internal deadlines for example). Also, please remember that the agreements you write must REFLECT IN GIT USAGE (e.g. issues with clear descriptions, making use of all milestones/labeling functionality that GitLab provides). 

### Communication

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: There is a plan for which channels to use and for which information to use them, but the whole section is inchoherent and lacks details (e.g. what are you actually sending in these channels). Also, Mattermost is a communication channel that you did not include in the section. 


### Commitment

Mark: Good

Feedback: The quality of work for both teammates and chair/notetaker should be measurable/quantifiable in any way (e.g. hours spent, clarity of the agenda, amount of notes, etc.). This should be definitely included in the code of conduct, along with more specific descriptions for the chair and notetaker commitment.


### Division of Tasks and Roles

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The information is clear and a schedule for the next meetings is provided. Great job! For the following weeks, please remember that this schedule should also be reflected in Gitlab (e.g. through issues related to the agenda).

### Meetings

Mark: Very good

Feedback: The meeting planning is well detailed and realistic, good job! As an addition, I think this section would benefit from having more detail regarding non-TA meeting coordination.

### Decision Making
 
Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Please discuss every topic in their specific section and do not add information where it doesn't belong. Apart from this, please include what to do in case a teammate really doesn't agree with a decision and how to involve the TA suggestions/feedback in your decisions.

### Dealing with Conflicts

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Again, there is not enough detail about dealing with conflicts. The code of conduct needs to be specific and measurable in order to be actually useful for your team development. What do you do if the conflict escalades? At which point in the conflict are you involving the TA?

### Guidance

Mark: Good

Feedback: The expectations are realistic, but they are not clear enough and lack some details. It is not specified what type of the content feedback you want, since it depends whether I am allowed to actually give you that feedback or not. For example, for the assignments, I am allowed to give you feedback if you ask for it, but for the code, I cannot give you any suggestions.

### Consequences

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: There is no clear agreement on the consequences. Again, the CoC needs to be specific, so please find some scenarios (e.g. missing a meeting) and add the consequences for that, along with an "other" scenario to cover the situations that you did not think about.

### Success Factors
 
Mark: Good

Feedback: Nice idea, but some more explanations would be useful. Be specific about your qualities and about how they will create an advantage for your team.

### Norms or Evaluation Criteria
 
Mark: Good

Feedback: Good and realistic criteria, but again can use more explanations. You should add a bit more information on WHY the criteria you selected is actually important for the team
