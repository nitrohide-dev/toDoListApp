## Formative Assessment

- **Chair**: Robert
- **Notetaker**: Atanas

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Both a chair and a minute taker were selected, which is great. Good job!

Reminder for next meetings: Please remember that it is MANDATORY to rotate roles every week.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was coherent, but quite short in terms of topics. The template was reinterpreted and adjusted to fit the team's preferences, which is okay, but keeping points like "announcements" and "check-in" are important for ensuring a good communication within your team and also allow me as a TA some time to give you updates, remind you of deadlines, etc. instead of interrupting you mid-way. 
Regarding the topic structure, I really liked the fact that you highlighted the most important questions for each topic. Next time, you can add some more detail to what subpoints need to be discussed.

Reminder for next meetings: Please remember to add this document to the repository prior to every meeting so I can have access to it and check its contents beforehand.

#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: The chair coordinated the meeting and presented the main points successfully. However, for the next meetings, please allow for some more time for the team members to expose their ideas regarding every topic, since at times it seemed like only the chairman did the planning (this happened especially when discussing the schedule).

#### Time management

Mark: Good

Feedback: The topics were all covered, which is great. However, for the next meetings please try to come up with more questions beforehand, since the TA meeting a great opportunity to ask for clarifications and feedback. Working on the assignments/discussing details about the implementation during this meeting and not in extra meetings is not necessarily productive when there are other possible topics to be covered, such as feedback on the backlog and code of conduct.

Reminder for next meetings: I can only give you feedback on the assignments (prior to the deadline) if you REQUEST it yourselves.

#### Minute taker performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: The notes contain the team agreements and assigned people for specific tasks, which is a good thing, but they can be more detailed (e.g. add the teammates' opinions on the discussion topics). I also appreciated that, along with fulfilling the notetaking role, the minute taker was also involved in the discussion and presented their ideas/concerns.

Reminder for next meetings: Please keep in mind to upload the notes right after every meeting on the repository and to write them down in the agenda (i.e. the agenda will be uploaded 2 times, one before the meeting with the topics and one after the meeting with the complete notes).

#### Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: As a team, you seem to communicate well and pay attention to each other's ideas. However, it seems like some of the people are more involved in the discussion and more eager to showcase their ideas than others. Please try to balance out the level of communication inside the group (and encourage team members to speak up instead of taking the lead, for example). This will help building your bond as a team.
