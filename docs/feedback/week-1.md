## Formative Assessment

#### 1) Self-organization

I've noticed that, during the Code of Conduct discussion, everybody was involved and tried to showcase their ideas.
I also appreciated that you were all receptive and interested both in your team members' professional opinions but also in them as people. I'm glad you seem to be getting along really well so far :).
This shows that you are already starting to create a bond as a team based on mutual trust and respect, which is very important throughout the course.

#### 2) Suggested Topics

Although in the beginning you were a bit reticent, you managed to successfully moderate the discussion and not be dependent on my input, which helps bulding your team bond.
Regarding the meeting structure, I think that today's discussion did not have a clear planning based on the lecture slides.
For the next meetings, I believe it would be better for you to know exactly the topics that need to be discussed and divide the time accordingly. It's a good thing that you managed to coordinate well enough so that you could cover all the topics, but some of them were not discussed as in-depth as needed, hence the need for time bounds for each topic.
In the teamwork lecture, you will receive more guidelines on how to coordinate and structure your meetings, so pay attention to them in order to improve your meeting productivity and quality :).
