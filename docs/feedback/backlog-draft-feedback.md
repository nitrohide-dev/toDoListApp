# Backlog

Hi! Just a note before you read the feedback and start panicking. This feedback is purely constructive (since it's only a draft) and will help you in getting a good grade for the final version of the backlog. Please read it **carefully** and adjust **everything** (or almost everything) I mentioned below. This is standardized feedback, meaning it's based on a clear rubric and I am pointing out all the things you miss from that rubric, thus it may come off as a bit harsh. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them during the TA Meeting. :)

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The file is correctly submitted.


### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The backlog includes the stakeholders and terminology sections, but you **need** to structure your user stories in **EPICS** as stated on the course website. Thus, MoSCoW is not needed this year, the backlog for last year was an example and not a guideline. It is imperative to modify this in order to pass the assignment.
Regarding the level of clarity, you can add more details to the terminology. For example, the page definition is quite unclear, please consider reformulating it in more user-oriented terms instead of application-related terms.


### Epics

Mark: Insufficient (PLEASE ADJUST THIS IN ORDER TO PASS)

Feedback: Well, the epics are nonexistent. Please read the instructions on the website carefully and construct the epics like explained: they should have a description of the discussed feature (based on the client q&a's of course) and a list of user stories. Each epic can benefit from using a mock-up (so do mock-ups for each/some epics, i.e. parts of the functionality, rather than one for the whole application). To construct these epics, take into account the "minimal app" requirement stated on the website, **as well as the order of priority of the advanced features** that is presented in the introduction slides. 


### User Stories

Mark: Good

Feedback: Most of the user stories follow the required format ("As role I want functionality so that reason/goal/motivation") and have a clear focus on the user perspective, describing a single interaction per story. This is great :). 
A problem I've noticed regarding the content is that you do not mention anything regarding multi-boards and user teams. Please refer to the Client q&a slides to add this into your backlog, since it is of high priority in the advanced features list. However, since you have no epics (and therefore, no epic descriptions), I cannot check if you have any other "gaps" of explained functionality (parts of the app that are not explained), but this might not be true. Please make sure of this yourself before submitting the final version.


### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Sufficient (PLEASE ADJUST THIS IN ORDER TO PASS)

Feedback: The size of the user stories is small and their effect is clear, so most of the acceptance criteria is implicit. However, some user stories would benefit from adding some acceptance criteria, so make sure to check each story and adjust it accordingly.
Regarding clarity, the whole contents of the backlog need to be formulated in a **measurable** way, that allows to decide when a story is done/finished. Thus, go through the backlog one more time and either remove or add more quantifiable descriptions to "uncertain" words like: "easily", "faster", etc.
