# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Arpad
Minute taker: Jimmy

Mark: Pass


#### Agenda 

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The agenda is coherent, but again too short and doesn't properly follow the template provided by the course staff (sections are missing, see the week2 feedback for more details). Each meeting, you should strive to incorporate my feedback in your documents/behaviour, since it's very important from a Process viewpoint.
Also, please migrate the current format of the agenda to a **markdown** format.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

I added this feedback already in /docs/feedback/week2 file on Gitlab. I will give the feedback on the notes for this meeting in next meeting's feedback, due to this template change.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The chair ensured that all points are extensively covered and successfully coordinated the meeting. Good job!


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: It's good that you take ownership in the meeting and express your ideas. However, I would like to see more implication from the whole team, since this will ensure a more constructive athmosphere. Instead of trying to fill the silence yourselves, try to encourage the other teammate to express their opinions. 


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: Please start coding. From next week onward, you need to present everything you have submitted on the main branch in order to evaluate your progress.
Regarding **process** , research how branches are supposed to work: having a branch for every issue (not one per person), creating a branch from an issue, creating a development branch, etc. Please also learn how to write commits (the verb needs to be in the infinitive form, i.e. "Add a button ...", not "Adding a button ..."). All this information is widely available on the web, so just search up some of these basics and implement them with your team.
Please work with issues and document everything in those issues. Each issue should to contain (at least) 3 parts: Description, Definition of Done based on the backlog/acceptance criteria, Checklist with subtasks for this issue (the subtasks can be implementation specific). You can also search up how to integrate an issue template in Gitlab so you don't need to manually write this template for every issue.
